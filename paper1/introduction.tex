``You jump, I jump, right?'' When Rose gives up the lifeboat and exclaims to Jack, we are all deeply touched by the beautiful moving love story told by the movie \emph{Titanic}. As the saying goes, ``Movies dazzle us, entertain us, educate us, and delight us''. Movie, where characters would face various situations and perform various behaviors in various scenarios, is a reflection of our real world. It teaches us a lot such as the stories took place in the past, the culture and custom of a country or a place, the reaction and interaction of humans in different situations, \etc. Therefore, to understand movies is to understand our world.
